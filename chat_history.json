We need to replace this with Supabase to store and retrieve data from a central database.\n\n3.  **Modify CRUD Operations:** Update the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in `useFinancialData.ts` to interact with the Supabase database instead of `AsyncStorage`. This involves using Supabase's client library to perform database queries.\n\n4.  **Authentication Integration:** Ensure that user authentication is properly integrated with Supabase. When a user logs in, their user ID should be used to fetch their specific data from the Supabase database.\n\n5.  **Data Synchronization:** Implement a mechanism to synchronize data between the local app and the Supabase database.
